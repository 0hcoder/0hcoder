### 👋 Hi, I’m @0hcoder (Ankit Rawat)

- 👀 I’m interested in building clean and creative full-stack web apps with React, Node.js, and MongoDB.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced React patterns, animation libraries, and system design for scalable apps.
- 💼 Participating in CodeCircuit Hackathon — currently building a draggable sticky notes app with category-based filtering.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun frontend-focused projects or open source tools that help developers.
